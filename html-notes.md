# HTML notes

## About HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages and is a fundamental technology for building websites. HTML provides a way to structure the content of a web page by using various elements and tags to define the layout, text, images, links, forms, and other elements that make up a webpage.

HTML documents consist of a series of elements enclosed in tags. Tags are used to define the structure and appearance of content on a web page. For example, you can use HTML tags to create headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links, and more. These tags are interpreted by web browsers to render web pages correctly.
