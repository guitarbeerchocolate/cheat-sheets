# SCRUM Cheat Sheet

## Introduction to SCRUM

SCRUM is a framework used for Agile software development. It focuses on iterative and incremental development, fostering collaboration, and delivering high-value products.

## Key Roles in SCRUM

1. **Product Owner:** Represents stakeholders, defines product backlog items, and prioritizes them.
2. **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures the team adheres to the framework.
3. **Development Team:** Self-organizing team responsible for delivering product increments.

## SCRUM Artifacts

1. **Product Backlog:** An ordered list of all desired product features, maintained by the Product Owner.
2. **Sprint Backlog:** A subset of the Product Backlog for the current Sprint, chosen by the Development Team.
3. **Increment:** The product's potentially shippable version created during a Sprint.
4. **Definition of Done (DoD):** A set of criteria that must be met for a product increment to be considered complete.

## SCRUM Events

1. **Sprint:** A time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) during which a potentially shippable product increment is created.
2. **Sprint Planning:** A meeting at the beginning of a Sprint to plan the work and select items from the Product Backlog.
3. **Daily Scrum:** A daily stand-up meeting for the Development Team to discuss progress and plan the day's work.
4. **Sprint Review:** A meeting at the end of a Sprint to review and demonstrate the increment to stakeholders.
5. **Sprint Retrospective:** A meeting at the end of a Sprint for the team to reflect on their process and make improvements.

## SCRUM Flow

1. **Product Backlog Refinement:** Ongoing process of clarifying, estimating, and prioritizing backlog items.
2. **Sprint Planning:** Decide which backlog items to work on during the Sprint.
3. **Daily Scrum:** Short daily meetings to discuss progress and plan the day's work.
4. **Sprint:** Develop, test, and integrate the selected backlog items.
5. **Sprint Review:** Showcase the completed increment and gather feedback.
6. **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on the Sprint and make process improvements.

## SCRUM Principles

1. **Transparency:** Make all work, progress, and issues visible to the team and stakeholders.
2. **Inspection:** Continuously evaluate the product and process to identify areas for improvement.
3. **Adaptation:** Make necessary changes based on inspection results to optimize outcomes.

## SCRUM Values

1. **Commitment:** The team commits to achieving its goals and delivering high-quality work.
2. **Courage:** The team has the courage to address issues and risks transparently.
3. **Focus:** The team focuses on delivering a valuable product increment.
4. **Openness:** The team and stakeholders are open and honest in their communication.
5. **Respect:** The team respects each other's skills, perspectives, and roles.

## Benefits of SCRUM

1. **Faster Delivery:** Frequent increments lead to faster delivery of valuable features.
2. **Adaptability:** Agile principles allow for changes based on feedback and market needs.
3. **Increased Collaboration:** Cross-functional teams collaborate closely.
4. **Improved Quality:** Continuous testing and review ensure high-quality products.
5. **Customer Satisfaction:** Focus on delivering customer value increases satisfaction.
